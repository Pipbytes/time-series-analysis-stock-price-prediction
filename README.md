# Time Series Analysis: Stock Price Prediction

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the application of various time series analysis techniques to predict stock prices. This project employs multiple statistical and machine learning models to forecast future prices using historical market data.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explore and apply different time series forecasting methods to predict stock prices, leveraging historical market data to discern patterns and predict future trends effectively.

## Features

- **Multiple Forecasting Models**: Implements Linear Regression, Holt-Winters, ARIMA, and VAR models to address different data characteristics.
- **Comprehensive Data Preprocessing**: Involves normalization, handling missing values, stationarity checks, and cointegration checks to prepare data for analysis.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Deep dive into data characteristics using Pearson correlation, ADF Test for stationarity, and Cointegration Tests.
- **Visualization**: Extensive plots for data exploration and result presentation to facilitate intuitive understanding and analysis.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Retrieve historical stock price data from reputable financial market databases.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Clean and normalize the data to ensure consistency and reliability for analysis.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Perform preliminary analyses to understand the dataâ€™s underlying patterns and characteristics.

4. **Modeling**:
   - Deploy several forecasting models:
     - **Linear Regression**: Captures linear relationships.
     - **Holt-Winters**: Addresses seasonality and trends.
     - **ARIMA**: Suitable for non-seasonal data prediction.
     - **VAR**: Analyzes the interrelationships between multiple variables.

5. **Evaluation**:
   - Assess model performance using MSE, MAPE, RMSE, and R^2 to ensure accuracy.

6. **Visualization**:
   - Compare and contrast predictions against actual data visually.

## Future Work

- Explore more sophisticated models like SARIMAX, VARIMAX, LSTM, or Prophet to enhance forecasting accuracy.
- Integrate price data with company financial statements, and economic data to enrich analysis.
- Expand the analysis to include real-time data feeds for dynamic prediction capabilities.
